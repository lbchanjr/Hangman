            RULES OF THE GAME
-------------------------------------------

- The goal of the player is to guess all the letters of random word(s) 
that will appear on the screen for each game level. 
- In order to win the game, the player must guess all random word(s) that
will appear in all five levels of the game. 
- The number of letters of each random word(s) to guess for a level may be 
determined by counting the number of placeholders (i.e '-' or dashes) that 
will be displayed prior to the first guess. 
- In each level, the game will allow the user 10 chances to guess the word(s).
- Every time the user chooses an incorrect letter, their chances decrease as 
well as the game draws one element of the hanged man stick figure to indicate
the number of chances that are left for the user.
- Each time the player enters a correct letter, the same letter will replace
the placeholder associated with the actual occurrence(s) of that letter within
the word(s). 
- If the user guesses all the letters of the word before he/she runs out of
chances, the player will advance to the next level.
- If the player runs out of chances within a level, the player loses the game.
- Otherwise, if the player completes all five levels without running out of 
chances, he or she wins the game.
- The random word to guess for each level is taken from any of the three 
categories that the player chooses prior to starting the game.
- To keep track of the letters that the user had guessed in each level, the 
remaining letter of the alphabet (upper case only) will also be shown on the
screen as well as the letters that were incorrectly guessed.
